# CI/CD with Snowflake Notebooks

## Overview

This document explains the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying and synchronizing Snowflake notebooks. Before implementing CI/CD, initial data objects must be created to establish the required environment.

## Initial Data Object Creation

Before executing the CI/CD pipeline, we need to set up fundamental Snowflake objects, including:

1. **User and Role Setup**

   - A dedicated role (`FRED_ROLE`) is created and assigned necessary permissions.
   - A user (`DBT_DEV`) is assigned to the role.

2. **Database and Schema Creation**

   - The database (`FRED_DB`) and essential schemas (`INTEGRATIONS`, `FRED_RAW`, `FRED_HARMONIZED`, `FRED_ANALYTICS`) are created.

3. **Warehouse and Compute Setup**

   - A Snowflake warehouse (`FRED_WH`) is configured for query execution.

4. **Secret Management**

   - AWS credentials and GitHub credentials are securely stored using Snowflake secrets.

5. **Network Configuration**

   - External access integrations and network rules are established to connect with external data sources.

6. **Data Storage and Processing**

   - Stages, tables, streams, and materialized views are created for handling data efficiently.
   - Snowflake functions and stored procedures are implemented for automation.

## Deploy and Synchronize Notebooks

1. **Deploy Notebooks**
   - The CI/CD pipeline ensures that all Snowflake notebooks are deployed from the repository to the Snowflake environment.
   - Notebooks are executed automatically to maintain an updated and consistent Snowflake environment.

2. **Automated Synchronization**
   - Any changes made to the `.ipynb` files in the repository are automatically fetched and applied to Snowflake.
   - The latest version of each notebook is set as the live version and executed to reflect updates in the environment.

## Summary

This CI/CD pipeline ensures a structured and automated approach to deploying and synchronizing Snowflake notebooks. By establishing initial data objects and leveraging GitHub Actions, teams can efficiently manage data workflows and maintain a stable production environment.
